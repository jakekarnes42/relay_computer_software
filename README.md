# Relay Computer (Software)
This repo contains the software information for a computer constructed out of relays. Its hardware companion project can be found [here](https://github.com/jakekarnes42/relay_computer_hardware). 

The documentation is still a work-in-progress and is likely to change as the design itself changes. 

## Project Dev Setup
General development environment:
* Java 11
* Maven
* Git
* DOSBox (for testing against original eForth). Install `dosemu`
* Copy relay_computer_software/computer/eForth directory to the home directory.
