# Relay Computer (Software)
This repo contains the software information for a computer constructed out of relays. Its hardware companion project can be found [here](https://github.com/jakekarnes42/relay_computer_hardware). 

The documentation is still a work-in-progress and is likely to change as the design itself changes.
